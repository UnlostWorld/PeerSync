# Peer Sync
Peer Sync is a plugin for sharing mods peer-to-peer.  

 

## RISKS

Peer-to-peer transfer has unique risks compred to other mod-syncing solutions. Please read this list of risks carefully, and do not use Peer Sync unless you understand them. Feel free to reach out on Discord if you do not understand and would like further explanation. 

 

The biggest risk of Peer Sync is the exposing of your IP address to peers you have paired with. 
The sharing of your IP address can be used to: 
- DDoS your system 
- Find your rough geographical location 
- Open you up to malware 


There are ways to minimise these risks. The first and best way to reduce harm is to only pair with people you trust. Think about who would be trustworthy to have the kind of access that comes from knowing your IP address.  

If you are concerned about your IP address, using Peer Sync over a VPN would obscure you IP address, or changing your IP address regularly can mitigate risks.

The other risks of using Peer Sync are the same or similar as other mod-syncing plugins. There is no guarantee that the mods you recieve from others are desireable.
